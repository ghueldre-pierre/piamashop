## Introduction

### About this repository

This repository is meant to be used as a training camp to develop my skills.

The name I've chosen for this project *Piamashop* is the composition of my first name's two first letters followed by the three first letters of *amazon* and finally the word shop to indicate what this project is all about ; that is, an online shop quite similar to amazon in the scope of merchandise it will offer.

### About my way of working

In the era of AI, I feel the necessity to emphasize that I don't use AI to generate my documentation nor to code. I'm not completely against using AI but I'm here to train my brain not the other way around.

Finally, despite english not being my mother tongue I use it to write this document because I want it to be understood by the greatest number of people. In the same manner that I don't use AI, I don't directly use automatic translation tools : by directly I mean that I don't write in my native language then pass it into an automatic translation tool ; I write in english directly and use translation tool to assist me when I'm not sure about the way to formulate something and also to verify that what I've written make sense.

## Documentation

Writing good documentation is a pretty complicated task, but in my experience, starting a project without writing any is the best way to waste time in the long run.

The documentation is divided in two parts : general part and technical part. The general part is meant to be read by every participants in the project while the technical one by the developers.

For the moment, the documentation is : 

- only available in my native language (*that is in french*) because it is the most natural way for me to write ;
- at the state of a draft : I'm still working on it
